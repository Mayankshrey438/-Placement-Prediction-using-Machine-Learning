# -Placement-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This repository contains the code and data for predicting student placement outcomes using machine learning techniques. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation, all structured in a Jupyter Notebook format.


## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a student will be placed in a company or not based on their academic performance, skills, and other relevant factors. The project involves:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training using various machine learning algorithms
- Model evaluation and comparison


## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes various features such as:

- Academic scores (e.g., SSC, HSC, Degree, MBA)
- Specialization
- Work experience
- Placement status
